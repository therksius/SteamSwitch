v1.5 changes:
	Added context menu for user buttons (start offline/online, reload avatar)
	Added tab pages when user buttons take up too much space (scrollwheel can change tabs)
	Updated images used for default (downloading) and missing avatars
	Added method to search for avatar if user doesn't have Custom URL set in their profile
	Changed avatar downloading procedure (now downloads in background, not making main app hang)
	Added individual avatar reload capability, also changed the procedure for avatar reload
	Show banner with context menu at top of window when Steam is running
	Moved Steam shutdown code out of _SteamLogin into new function (_SteamClose)
	Enforced max window dimensions (about 80% width, 70% height)
	Changed config folder structure. Put avatars in their own subfolder (easier to clear/reload), changed userlist filename
	Renamed some variables, moved some into global scope (needed for outside functions)
	Update Steam config (loginusers.vdf) on every launch to ensure Timestamp value is always current (theoretically preventing password timeout)
	Warn if Steam config write/edit fails
	Added lots of commentary (pretty much all commented now I think)
