v1.5 changes:

- Added context menu for user buttons (start offline/online, reload avatar).
- Added tab pages when user buttons take up too much space (scrollwheel changes tabs).
- Updated images used for default (downloading) and missing avatars.
- Redesigned Add Users dialog.
- Added method to search for avatar if user doesn't have Custom URL set in their profile.
- Changed avatar downloading procedure.
- Added individual avatar reload capability, also changed the procedure for avatar reload.
- Show banner with context menu at top of window when Steam is running.
- Moved Steam shutdown code out of _SteamLogin into new function (_SteamClose).
- Enforced max window dimensions (about 80% width, 70% height).
- Changed config folder structure. Put avatars in their own subfolder (easier to clear/reload), changed userlist filename.
- Renamed some variables, moved some into global scope (needed for outside functions).
- Changed _SteamConfig function. Now using StringRegExpReplace to adjust values rather than discarding/rewriting sections of the config.
- Run _SteamConfig on every launch to ensure Timestamp value is always current (theoretically preventing password expiration).
- Warn if _SteamConfig fails (could not find user in file, or could not write to file: loginusers.vdf).
- Added short aliases for command line options (/online = /on, /atMouse = /am, etc. see readme).
- Added lots of commentary (pretty much all commented now I think).
