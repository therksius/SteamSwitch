v1.5 changes:
	Added context menu for user buttons (start offline/online, reload avatar)
	Added tab pages when user buttons take up too much space (scrollwheel changes tabs)
	Updated images used for default (downloading) and missing avatars
	Changed avatar downloading procedure
	Show notice with options at top of window when Steam is running
	Moved Steam shutdown code out of _SteamLogin into new function (_SteamClose)
	Enforced max window dimensions (about 80% width, 70% height)
	Changed config folder structure. Put avatars in their own subfolder (easier to clear/reload), changed userlist filename
	Renamed some variables, moved some into global scope (needed for outside functions)
	Added lots of commentary (plan to add more)
